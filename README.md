# C++-Implementation-of-Java-BigInteger-library

Implementation of a large integer library, similar to what we have in Java as BigInteger. 

The library provides functionality to store arbitrarily large integer and perform basic math operations. Operations implemented are:

** - Fast exponentiation,**
** - GCD of 2 integers, and **
** - Factorial of a number**



#### Steps to run the code:

1. compile the code by: g++ main_bigInt.cpp -o obj

2. run as: ./obj

3. Enter an integer denoting the no. of testcases you want to run for

4. Then enter 1 of 3 choices:
   - 1 (For Fast exponentiation), followed by 2 numbers
   
   - 2 (For Gcd), followed by 2 numbers
   
   - 3 (For factorial), followed by a number
