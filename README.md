# C++-Implementation-of-Java-BigInteger-library

Implementation of a large integer library, similar to what we have in Java as BigInteger. 

The library provides functionality to store arbitrarily large integer and perform basic math operations. Operations implemented are:

__- Fast exponentiation,__

__- GCD of 2 integers, and__

__- Factorial of a number__

#### Steps to run the code:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. compile the code by: g++ main_bigInt.cpp -o obj
2. run as: ./obj
3. Enter an integer denoting the no. of testcases you want to run for
4. Then enter 1 of 3 choices:
   - 1 (For Fast exponentiation), followed by 2 numbers   
   - 2 (For Gcd), followed by 2 number   
   - 3 (For factorial), followed by a number
